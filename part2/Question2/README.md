Hireology Homework - Part 2 - Question 2
===

This is my first attempt at implementing a mini role-based access control system. Despite my inexperience with high-level design, this problem has been incredibly interesting to think about. Much time has been put into pondering over the concept and possible implementation instead of writing code. I started by reading the [RBAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) wiki post. The article is informative but could be overly verbose if you're new to this concept. Although the instructions did not require me to create a database for my solution, I built a couple tables with SQLFiddle in an attempt to visualize the interaction between my data models. The fiddle can be found [here](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!6/e1f94/1).
